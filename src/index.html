        <h3>Building Python web applications with the FARM stack</h3>
        <p class="max-w-md text-sm p-4">This book is a complete zero-to-hero guide to the FARM stack. The author took
            the time to break down React hooks, FastAPI routes and file structure, and
            MongoDB to the point that someone from a non-programming background can
            understand it and get up and running.</p>

        <div class="container prose p-10">
        <p class="my-3">Probably the best way to start using a new technology, or a new stack - a blend of technologies - is by
            using it. I have written this book with a particular reader in mind: myself.</p>
        <p class="my-3">While this is by no means a comprehensive guide to MongoDB or React - two mainstream technologies that have
            been around for some time, the book has another protagonist - fastAPI, a relatively young, but already mature 
            and battle tested Python-based asynchronous framework for building applications.
        </p>
        <p class="my-3">The book takes a practical approach and tries to introduce the parts of the stack in a simple and 
            straightforward way, while gradually presenting features - MongoDB queries, drivers, simple React Hooks, 
            the FastAPI way of performing standard and not-so-standard web development tasks.
        </p>
        <p class="my-3">
            This book is aimed at web developers and analysts who desire to include the power of a modern asynchronous Python framework, a flexible data store and a powerful UI library mixed with the combination of two of the most important programming languages today into their web developers toolkit. The book would also prove useful for various beginners in the field of information presentation. The book requires a beginner-level understanding of Python and JavaScript programming, HTML and CSS.

        <h2 class="p-10 text-5xl">What's inside the book?</h2>
 
        <p class=" mx-auto max-w-prose text-lg">The book is aimed at giving the readers a basic, yet thorough understanding of the FARM stack components and 
            of the possibilities offered by the framework. Here is a brief rundown of the chapters.</p>
        <div class="grid lg:grid-cols-2 my-10">
        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Chapter 1: Web Development and the FARM Stack</h2>
            <p>We try to make a case for this partticular type of stack - comparing
                the FARM stack and its components to other, more popular, alternatives. And it makes sense!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Chapter 2: Setting Up the Document Store with MongoDB</h2>
            <p>A rather thourough look at MongoDB - what it is, why it is almost perfect for some types of solutions and 
                why it might not be the best fit for others. The chapter goes over CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) 
                and setting up MongoDB locally and on the cloud with Atlas. this chapter is rather self-sufficient as the basic knowledge 
                acquired can be easily used with Node.js or other Python frameworks!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Chapter 3: Getting Started with FastAPI</h2>
            <p>it is time to meet FastAPI - the coolest and brightest Python framework of our time! We go over standard 
                REST verbs, such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, we pass query and path parameters, play with the request 
                body and learn some overall useful stuff along the way. FastAPI shouldn't be intimidating after this one!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Chapter 4: Setting Up a React Workflow</h2>
            <p>React is a powerful UI library and this chapter doesn't try to teach you very much. It is just a means to an end - 
                we go over what React achieves, the basic syntax, JSX and the creation of components and how to set up a new project.
                Alright, we talk a bit about two of the most popular and arguably most important Hooks - the useState and the useEffect.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Chapter 5: Building the Backend for Our Application</h2>
            <p>We begin building a very simple but ful-fledged API: we start by setting up MongoDB, we create an instance 
                of FastAPI and then we create our routes. Finally we deploy our app to Heroku. <span class="sad">Note:
                at the time of writing this book, Heroku still offered a free plan. Now it seems that it is not the case anymore.
                It is a bummer, but there are other options out there and Heroku could be well worth paying. 
                </span> I certainly plan to update the code with a free provider since that was one of the main goals while writing 
                the book - create simple, but complete apps, that can be hosted for free or at very cheap prices.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Chapter 6: Building the Frontend of the Application</h2>
            <p>Now that we have a backend, it is time to connect it to a frontend. This chapter demonstrates a very simple 
                React application featuring Tailwind CSS (our CSS framework of choice) and the latest version of the React Router 
                - version 6. We create a single page app (SPA) that is able to talk (rather eloquently) to our simple FastAPI.
                You might not like this approach, but I happen to love it - you create something small and simple (maybe even silly) but 
                then you see it all connecting together and you can already picture something more complex. It works for me, at least.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Chapter 7: Authentication and Authorization</h2>
            <p>Soon you will find out that, no matter how simple or small your application is, chances are it will 
                not be usable if it hasn't at least a way of knowing which user is which. I had a dilemma facing this one: 
                should I be treating Auth0 or Firebase or some of these giants - or should I concentrate on rolling your own solution, 
                even though chances are you wouldn't be able to use it anywhere in a serious real-life project? 
                I opted for the latter as I believe that it is a much more instructive approach and it leaves you as a reader much more aware 
                of the steps involved, the mechanisms and the potential risks. JWT tokens are a very popular solution and although 
                we develop a rather simple variation of a JWT-based authentication system (for instance, there are no refresh tokens) 
                the chapter should give you enough information so that in the future you can dive into JWT systems in other frameworks.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Chapter 8: Server-Side Rendering and Image Processing with FastAPI and Next.js</h2>
            <p>Here we tackle different real-life web development problems in a fun way!</p>
            <ol class=" list-disc">
                <li>File uploads? Check!</li>
                <li>Image processing? Both with Python (Pillow) and Cloduinary? Check!</li>
                <li>Server-side rendering (SSR)? Static generation? Check!</li>
                <li>The worlds most feature-rich frontend framework? You bet!</li>
                <li>Next.js API routes? Authentications with <span class="sad">httpOnly</span> cookies? Check!</li>
                <li>Deployment on Vercel? Check!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Jokes aside, in this chapter we create a simple app that shows that FastAPI is very 
                confortable in a universal role: image and file manipulation, playing nice with Next.js. 
            We also get to use Vercel, an excellent deployment solution from the authors of Next.js. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Chapter 9: Building a Data Visualization App with the FARM Stack</h2>
            <p>This is probably my favourite chapter, and certainly the one I've had the most fun writing.
                FastAPI excels at working with different types of data and here we take it for a spin building 
                a simple, yet expandable and flexible admin dashboard. We also get to know SWR (stale while revalidate)
                and the way it helps us fetch data from React, improving our UX. 
            </p>
            <p>You will get to know Chart.js, an excellent charting library that hits a sweet spot between ease of use 
                and customizability. We also get to send some emails, create documents and other fun stuff!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Chapter 10: Caching with Redis and Deployment on Ubuntu (DigitalOcean)
                and Netlify</h2>
            <p>
                Continuing where we left off, we will learn to deploy our analytics app on an Ubuntu Server, 
                using a rather cheap DigitalOcean droplet, using Uvicorn, Gunicorn and the mighty Nginx server. We will
                also explore a caching solution with Redis and use Netlify, arguably the most popular deployment service, 
                for our frontend. Good stuff!
            </p>
            
        </div>

        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>Chapter 11: Useful Resources and Project Ideas</h2>
            <p>
                To close things off, the last chapter takes a lighter approach. Except for a few reccomandations or 
                suggestions, the chapter includes some creative ideas for you (and me!) to test your FARM stack knowledge 
                and creativity. I hope that I will be able to update this portion and maybe add numerous ideas, snippets or links!
            </p>

        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>GitHub: Book Resources</h2>
            <p>The GitHub repo for the book is located at <a href="">this link</a> and it should be updated with some 
                additional info, regarding especially the <a href="">new Heroku situation</a>, as well as fixing errors.
                Please do not hesitate to let me know if you find errors, small ones, big ones or ways to make the code more 
                illustrative or concise.
            </p>

        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>What is <span class=" text-ftRed">not</span> inside</h2>
            <p>Writing really boils down to two things: what to write about and what to omit. This book is pretty opinionated
                and doesn't include some topics that you would maybe expect to find in a FastAPI book, so I think that it is 
                only fair to mention what is <span class="text-ftRed">not covered</span>:
                <ol class=" list-disc">
                    <li>SQL databases (because, you know... MongoDB)</li>
                    <li>Jinja2 or any other Python templating system, becaouse we use React</li>
                    <li>Other User-Interface frameworks</li>
                    <li>While we do embed a simple Random Forest regressor, machine learning is not covered</li>
                    <li>Deployment on Docker containers (see above)</li>
                    <li>Third-party authentication systems like Auth0, Cognito, Firebase</li>
                    <li>There is no in-depth React coverage - there would simply be no space</li>
                    <li>No basic Python or JavaScript tutorials or introductions</li>
                    <li>Testing</li>

        <h2 class="p-10 text-3xl text-gray-500">Technologies used in the book</h2>
        <div class="container p-10">
            <p class="my-2">I have tried to use modern and up to date technologies that enable developers and alike to
                quickly get up and running. FastAPI is an excellent newcomer into the React / MongoDB stacks (MERN, MEAN, PERN) 
                 and I really believe that developers could benefit from the inclusion of the Python ecosystem 
                 through an async communication. 
            </p>
            <p class="my-2">Where possible, I have tried to include simple and free or at least very cheap solutions, since I am a firm 
                believer in the try-before-you-buy philosophy. I have intentionally ommited complex deployment solutions 
                based on Docker containers and the "big" platforms (Azure, Google App Engine), since in most cases, especially 
                if you are working with some smaller, in-house, application, you will want to deploy early and quickly, hopefully
                with minimal payment requirements. Unfortunately, in the brief weeks between the writing of the book and the 
                publishing, Heroku seems to have ceased to provide its free service, but that should not be a game-changer or 
                prevent you from diving into the stack.
